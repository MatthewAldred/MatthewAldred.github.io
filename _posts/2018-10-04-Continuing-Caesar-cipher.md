  <tr>
    <td>Starting point?</td>
    <td>At the start, we knew how to make translate into the caesar cipher code, but often received error messages.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To understand how to use google sheets to translate to and from a caesar cipher. For homework, also to create a further and more complex caesar cipher.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target?
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, I now know how to use translate to and from caesar code with google sheets. This will be the beginning of the computational thought process.</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by listening through the explanation and working with trial and error to figure out what i must do in order to achieve and succeed the task. I learnt by trying to understand what the certain phrase was an how i would put it in real life. I also attempted to remember as much as i could and test myself on the certain phrase a each interval.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I must attempt to concentrate more during the explanation, work faster during practical time and improve my concentration span in order to further my understanding and knowledge in the subject.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Next time, I will try to work faster and harder during the lesson time. I will attempt to distract less and be distracted less. By doing so, I believe I will become better during the process of computational thinking.</td>
