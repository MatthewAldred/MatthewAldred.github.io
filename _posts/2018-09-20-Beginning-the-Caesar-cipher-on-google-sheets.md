(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, I now know how to use basic code on google sheets for decoding a Caesar cipher.</td>

    <td>In the beginning he showed us a simple example with a very wired locking code, after a while, he explained to us that this was a code of some sort. He explained to us the basic history of the Caesar cipher and how to decode this piece. GDKKN became hello and we were already learning to a great potential. We opened up google sheets and wrote out the alphabet and Caesar cipher alphabet. I found that writing down a simple note would have been very helpful as I became very confused after attempting to retain all, of the new information.</td>

    <td>I need to take down simple and basic notes for a better and smoother lesson flow, to do this I will write down important information that I feel the need to retain and test myself before reminding myself of the steps of the upcoming activity. I believe this will help me immensely, improve my knowledge and extend my understanding of the decoding or any exercise. </td>
